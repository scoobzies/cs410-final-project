CS 441,"Easy A, but did not meet my expectations. This class consists of a set of lectures per week, a quiz with unlimited attempts and some sort of MP. The quizzes are free points and the MPs are pretty straightforward. There is a final project as well, but not a lot is asked of you.

I found the lectures to this course to be very dry and unengaging. The MPs are basically just implementing mathematical formulas found in the lecture slides. The final project isn't much more than copying and pasting code from pytorch. Since the course advertised Applied Machine Learning, I was hoping for the course to tie more into practical applications of ML rather than being a course focused solely on theory and Math. However, if that's your jam, this course may be for you.

That said, the class is an easy A if you do all the MPs. Make SURE you are getting 100s or close to it on most every assignment though. The grading cutoffs are much higher than other courses and a lot of students ended up in trouble at the end of course grade wise.",easy,6
CS 441,"I had done a lot of ML related classes in undergrad (AI, ML, Deep Learning sequence) so this was mostly a refresher and a numpy course for me. I think there would be a lot of value for someone who hasn't seen the content before and is interested in the basics of the field before going into more industry current classes. This was also a nice easy A, which was a good refresher after a few of the harder classes in the program. Jupyter notebooks/python/numpy are also used a lot in industry and other classes, so it's relevant background knowledge content for jobs in certain fields (although it's definitely in the ""necessary but not sufficient"" territory)",very easy,4
CS 441,"This was the first course I took for the online MCS program. I took it because of two reasons: an interest in machine learning and because other reviews made it seem like a good first class to dip my toes back into the college learning experience after a few years. For the latter case, the class was as advertised - low workload, low stress, very easy assignments. For the first case, you don't really learn much at all. The lectures are very poorly articulated and usually just a bunch of equations thrown up on the screen without much explanation. Sometimes it seemed like the professor was confused as well and had to pause. There are a wide variety of topics so most of them are only discussed skin deep. I get that you could learn more, and get more to stick with you by diving into the textbook, but then you can just buy the book instead of taking the class. The assignments and quizzes are all very easy - the most difficult one maybe taking a few hours, most of the real meat is already coded for you. However, I was more disappointed with the lectures than the assignments. So as an easy A class very good, as an in-depth dive into machine learning not good - I learned some stuff but not much. For reference for workload, I work a full time job and was able to get an A without any impact to my social life, maybe a couple hours of video games were sacrificed.",very easy,3
CS 411,"I came from a data science background already, and thought this would be a good review of concepts. However, I found the lectures were not very good - boring and hard to follow even with prior knowledge on these topics. The MPs were a bit more educational, but a lot of it was just filling in a few lines of code here and there. Everything is auto graded, so it's easy to get the grade you want. Overall, an easy A and way to check off a requirement, but I wish I took another class. I highly recommend PSL over this if you're interested in ML algorithms.",very easy,6
CS 410,"Easy, enjoyable, but had its issues. Course is extremely straightforward and setup for everyone to do well. The quizzes and MPs are setup where there's no reason to not get 100s on both of them and the group project is an easy A if you follow all the requirements. The lectures are a bit dated and not super exciting but easy enough to follow and the material was interesting. Exams were split, first one was rather difficult but second one was a breeze. The main issue with the course was the lack of communication there were multiple issues with MPs and due dates in general and the proff/TAs were radio silent at times which was frustrating. It did all work out in the end and nothing ever felt unfair, but I think better planning and communication would make this course go from good to great.",very easy,5
CS 410,"Best Class So Far. MP's need to be Improved. TIS has been the best course experience I've had so far as part of the UIUC MCS. However, there are a few problems.
Lectures can be dull, but they cover interesting content.
MP's are way too short and are not comprehensive. Some MP's can be finished in 30 minutes and I wouldn't say I learned much from them.
Exams are also not comprehensive. There is so much material to cover in terms of lectures, however, the exam only tests some concepts. I felt the exams were too easy and didn't match the difficulty of the lectures.
The quizzes are easy to complete.
The project is doable, and there's lots of flexibility and time to complete whatever your group sets out to do.
So far, this is a perfect easy-medium class.",medium,8
CS 410 ,"This is an easy A, but you have to work for an A+. I listed 5 hours a week as a minimum workload if you watch all the lectures. A lot of the workload is on the backend, if you actually put effort into the final project.
Final Project: I personally enjoyed my project, as it met the criterion of something novel, that was related to text processing. I reviewed 3 students final projects, two of which were plagiarized, unoriginal, and there was not a chance they met the minimum 20 hour threshold. That was disheartening.
Exams: Some of the verbiage on the exams was quite poor. Including a couple questions where a native speaker of English would see ambiguity and answer one way (and get it wrong). Additionally, I had no idea what I got wrong on Exam 1 ever. What's the point of taking exams if you're not going to get feedback?
Quizzes: Listen to the lectures, use the course slides and your notes -> get a 100 on the quizzes.
Projects: Some of the projects seemed like they were basically us grad students doing the leg work for a TAs thesis. For one of the projects the TAs uploaded the wrong test data to github and several people (including me) spent hours trying to reach a leaderboard threshold that was impossible. No apologies issued. The last project was a super vague one about solving a poorly documented algorithm. Oh, and then they added on an optional project at the end that could supplant the lowest grade. This would have been nice to know ahead of time. Projects overall were quite disorganized. Livedatalab was terrible.
Tech Review: I don't even know if anyone even looked at mine. It is ungraded.
Lectures: I thought the lectures were pretty well-organized and delivered.
Communication: I sent a couple messages to the TAs about my concern regarding a project meeting the threshold for originality, and I never got a response. The campuswire forum was pretty active and students were encouraged to participate by the prospect of extra credit for the top participants.
This course had a lot of potential, but, in the end, fell short.",easy,5
CS 410,"To start off, I am an idiot. I don't have a CS background and this was my first course in the program. The best advice I can give is to pick your battles on what you need to know and do, and what you can skip over. I personally skipped MP3, and MP4 cause I couldn't figure them out (again, I'm an idiot), and I should still end up with an A in the course. Exams are very easy; easier than any upper level exam I've ever taken. If you do well on the quizzes, you'll do well on the exams. The first couple MPs are very easy, they're only like 3 lines of code max. The project was fun, just pick something relevant to the course content that you know you can manage. The quizzes are free points basically if you understand the lectures properly. Lectures are very well laid out and relatively easy to understand. Sometimes there are massive slides of complex math and formulas but they're not too important. Like I said, pick your battles, you don't need to memorize these things. Just understand the main topics and don't get caught up on the complex formulas. Overall, very interesting, fun, easy course even for someone who doesn't have a CS background. The material was usually quite high-level. Be warned of week 9 content though. If it wasn't for MP3 and MP4, I would've ranked this course easier. Oh, and take notes while watching the lecture videos; helps to solidify the info better.",very easy,8
CS 410,"Grading is quite easy to get an A, but I didn't have any background in this topic so I still learned a lot. The required learning material seems pretty surface level but the resources and extra readings are there for people who want to dive deeper. The multiple choice quizzes and exams leave much to be desired and had me questioning if I was learning sufficiently in depth. But, the group project was good hands-on experience that showed me that I was indeed learning sufficient theory and implementation.",easy,10
CS 412,"While the textbook and topics covered in this course were interesting, much of the material felt like review for anyone with a machine learning background. My favorite sections were on Bayesian networks and F1 scores—not necessarily because they were taught particularly well, but because the course gave me a reason to revisit and deepen my understanding of those concepts. Unfortunately, the overall delivery left a lot to be desired. The lectures were monotonous and often shallow, with several slides containing errors. I even had to request corrections to one of the assignment handouts. Combined with the fact that the course is delivered entirely online through Coursera, the experience felt impersonal and low-effort. Overall, it didn’t feel like a good value for the tuition paid. That said, the assignments were decent, with some thought-provoking questions that weren’t overly math-heavy. The group project was also a highlight—it was self-directed and allowed us to explore any data science problem that interested us, which made it genuinely engaging.",easy,4
CS 412,"If you want to learn how netflix does recommendations, how target knows someone is pregnant before their partner does, and even a little bit about deep learning, this is a great class to take. It's a very broad survey of many algorithms and ideas. You will definitely learn a lot. Prof Ruby is very fair and active on campuswire. 3 proctored exams are a lowlight. You can use a 1 page of notes, but still, these exams are hard. I probably spent about 3 hrs studying per exam and I didn't get great grades on them. But by getting 100% on all quizzes and MPs (submit as many times as you need), plus a +5% Extra Credit assignment, I'll take home an A- and be happy with it.",medium,7
CS 412,"First the positives: I absolutely loved the MPs for the course. They did a great job of taking concepts introduced in the lectures and made us put them into practice and really solidified my understanding of various data mining algorithms. I should also note that the Prof. Taboub and the TA staff were quite responsive on the Campuswire message board and were good about answering questions there. However, the lecture videos I found painful to go through. The vast majority of the videos was simply Prof. Han reading off bullet points from his slides as he bulled his way from one concept to the next. The content was very heavy on details (which often felt like minutia) and light on context or exposition. (The most recently added lesson to the course on Deep Learning and Neural Networks was an exception and was a substantial improvement compared to the rest of the content.) Similarly, the quiz and exam questions were often about specific details which felt less about having an understanding of important concepts and more an exercise on how good your notes were or if you happened to include the right details on your cheat sheet. For what is meant to be an introductory-level class, I felt like I was basically deluged with the details over a large breadth of concepts without having a proper understanding of most of them. While it was good to get some exposure to a bunch of different algorithms and processes, I think the class would be better if greater focus was placed on just a handful.",medium,8
CS 418,"This has been my favorite class in the program so far. It was a ton of work from the programming standpoint, but the lectures described the topics well, and the assignments gave the practical implementation experience. My only criticism is that the content documentation and assignment definitions were rather terse, making it a challenge to figure out just what was meant. The instructor and TAs were super responsive and helpful.",medium,10
CS 425,"excellent class with relevant, modern concepts. Wonderful prep for system design interviews, and course organization is efficient and has clearly been refined over time. Professor & TAs respond quickly on Campuswire. And though grading is stressful because it's curved and final exam grades aren't released, grades seem to be fairly distributed (got an A- despite a mediocre midterm grade and a total unknown final exam grade). though Prof Indy is knowledgeable and engaging, his attitude toward the online MCS section is frequently condescending. He responds to Campuswire posts quickly but rarely provides useful responses - the vast majority are passive aggressive comments that link to prior posts that are related, but don't address the poster's question. It's extremely frustrating to get repeated comments telling you to look at post #642 when your question is about the same topic, but specifically on an edge case not discussed in #642. As mentioned above, grading is stressful but fair. Final grade distributions and final exam grades aren't released, and median grades are only released for some assignments (like the midterm and the 4 homework assignments). As a result, I had no idea what grade to expect until it was released. In hindsight, grading seems fair, but I do wish there was more transparency.

MPs are challenging but wonderful opportunities to learn. Yes, the starter code is tricky - it's meant to model a real distributed network. Yes, most classes in this program don't require C/C++ programming, and dealing with memory issues is a unique challenge - but no one should be graduating with a Masters in Computer Science without knowing how memory management works. Expect to spend 15+ hours on each of the two MPs.

Still one of the best classes I've taken. It's not the easiest 'A' and it won't give you a low stress semester, but you'll learn.
",very hard,15
CS 425,"This was the hardest course I've taken and not sure if it was really worth it. It is a good introduction to distributed systems and I learned a lot but this course covers too many topics and doesn't really go in depth. I might have been better off taking an easier course and just reading a book on distributed systems. The reason I'm not too fond of this course was because of the stress from grading and this being my last course before graduating - I needed a B- to get credit. Unfortunately, they don't give you a grading scale so you have no idea what grade you have all semester, though they do give you average/median grades for certain assignments. And the curve at the end seemed to be generous.",hard,15
CS 425,"This was a quality course that was well organized. By the end you'll feel confident about being able to meaningfully contribute (as a noob, but still) to the inner workings of the major cloud providers like AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure. More specifically, you'll end up with a good understanding of how to coordinate a distributed system (i.e., a bunch of computers working together to create a flexible and fault-tolerant system).

If (and this is a big if), you have a good software engineering background and are at least familiar with C++, the MPs really aren't that bad. There's only two of them, and they only took a couple days for me to get working. To be sure, not everyone had that experience, so take that with a grain of salt. But I will say that the way the professor and course staff were constantly like ""BEWARE"" about the MPs, which felt like overkill. Yes, don't start working on them the day before they're due, but starting 3 weeks early is also unnecessary. If you've got the time 3 weeks prior, by all means, go attack them, but don't feel like you've gotta start that early.

In my opinion, what's actually way more important for success in the course than coding experience is having a decent logic / proof background (majored in math as an undergrad, I felt well prepared). The reason why I say this is that the four homeworks are TYPED. Yes, you read that right. You have to reason out your answers, and you don't write any code. And the exams basically just homeworks-on-a-timer, so the bulk of the course requires having the skills to do well on these. Said another way, you could ace the MPs with a bit of C++ knowledge and yet do poorly on the homeworks and exams.

The exams are hard. With a relatively little amount of time, you have to type out correct and well reasoned answers. If you don't know how to do a question, you aren't going to have much time at all to go figure it out, which makes the experience stressful. Thankfully the exams did not use ProctorU, which was much appreciated.

Supposedly the course is graded on a curve.

The course uses Piazza to share information. There was lively discussion on there that helped me out and I believe helped many others. Professor Indy and the rest of the staff were very responsive on Piazza, and I'd say quite generous with their responses. They did not give out free answers, despite people regularly asking for them, and Prof Indy did not mince words when people kept asking the same question in different ways -- ""I'm not going to tell you; go figure it out"" was usually the message he was trying to get across, which some students didn't seem to understand or accept.",hard,15
CS 427,"This class is quizzes (3 attempts, free points) 4-5 MPs, and a course project. Lectures and MPs I imagine would be decent if you had no software engineering experience, but if you already are one I doubt you'll learn anything.

Project wasn't to bad, but like any project it'll depend on the quality of your group.

Wouldn't advise taking if you're already an SWE if you want to learn, but if you want an easy A, this class is for you.",easy,4
CS 427,"I've programmed a bit as a solo programmer, and my career has largely been around data analytics, so SWE was a fairly new concept to me. The MPs aren't too bad, the lectures could be better, but I enjoyed the group project and learned a lot from it. A couple of the group members weren't very good/responsive, so that sucked, but if you get a good group it can be a great hands-on learning experience. The professor Darko Marinov was very responsive and you could tell he was trying very hard. Great job by him and the TAs. I do wish the lectures were better to be honest though. A relatively easy A if you put in the work.",easy,12
CS 427,"It felt kinda similar to my undergrad class on the same topic. The content is good if you haven't seen it before (good safe space to learn git, a core skill. and android development was an interesting niche to explore, as well as writing unit tests which most jobs need). The group project was good, but a much larger group than most classes - leading to the usual dynamics of a few people slacking off and others having to carry the load. The course content was fine though and the workload was reasonable. If you haven't yet had an internship in the field, this could be a good class for aspiring software engineers to learn some best practices/basics. the MP's were well scoped and not too difficult.

",easy,4
CS 427,"I took this class at the same time I started as a software engineer and found that certain aspects such as project planning, design patterns, and test infrastructures were useful as I hadn't used them in a formal environment before. I can't see this being as useful for someone that has already been a software engineer. The class consisted of a couple mps, a final project in a group of ~7, lectures, weekly quizzes, a final, and a book review. The mps were not difficult but complimented the lectures well. The project was an android app and the difficulty lied with managing a large group and programming in a language none of us were familiar with. The final was proctored and the book review was really what you made of it.",easy,7
CS 437,"It's really cool to give your code a physical form. Most of the labs in this course will center around a raspberry pi car, and you'll do a range of practical applications. Lectures are good quality and please do watch them if you're interested, but to be honest, you don't really need to in order to complete the course with an A. 5 labs + final project + unlimited retry coursera quizes, no exams.
If you have good group partners in a group of 4, you'll get through the assignments as easily as any other standard course in the MCS program. You won't need to spend 20+ hours per week on the course if you have good partners and divide up the work fairly.
The reviews talking about the super heavy courseload I suspect are coming from those who were daring enough to think ""I can do this whole course alone, I'll learn more this way!"" or they just had bad luck with bad partners.
You can get access to all the course content early, so if you were really inclined to, you and your parnters could actually complete the whole course months in advance if you grinded hard at it, and someone in the UIUC mcs slack channel claims to have done that.

CS 437,"This course was AMAZING! The lectures were great. The quizzes were fair. And the labs were one of my favorite parts of the entire course. If you decide to take this course, make sure you have sufficient time to work on the labs because they are VERY demanding in the best way possible. There was a pretty lenient late submission penalty, but I would avoid submitting anything late because the labs are very demanding (especially labs 1 4 and 5). The grading was VERY generous and the course was not difficult at all. What made me put medium for difficulty is the workload required by the course. All of the lectures and quizzes can be completed in a couple of weekends. Since the labs are the only thing in this course that require so much time, it would do you well to start as early as you can, especially if you are doing everything solo like I did. Overall, this course was so much fun and I learned so much. I am not sure if the things I learned are applicable in the field I am in, but I would still highly recommend this course. It opened my eyes when it comes to IoT devices and how accessible and easy it is to create wonderful solutions.",medium,25
CS 437,"I really enjoy courses that do not make you take exams, however this course was very frustrating to take. I don't know if I just had a bad experience for the semester, but the the labs were just very unclear on what the requirements were and how to do what we were supposed to do. On top of that, the TAs were not helpful enough to make it clear on what to do. A lot of the time I spent going to office hours was asking what they wanted us to submit. For example, there was one lab where we had to use AWS. AWS was not covered in any of the lectures, and we had to figure out what to do not from the lab documentation itself, but from AWS tutorials. This was very frustrating and contributed to the workload. The lectures were very well put together however, if you like to learn that way you will learn a lot from them. However, I am not the type to sit and enjoy lectures. Overall the class wasn't ""difficult"" per se, but it was frustrating because of the obscurity of how to complete the work. That makes it difficult to work with.",medium,25
CS 437,"Probably one of my favourite courses yet! I cannot say enough good things about this course, even with some technical difficulties along the way.

The professor gives you a strong theoretical understanding of IOT during lectures, while the labs teach you a very different, but amazing set of practical skills. You get to build a robot kit car, program it for obstacle avoidance, basic mapping, computer vision and basic automated driving. Beyond this, you also implement firewalls, learn about networking, big data for a vehicle emissions machine learning project, and implement your own IOT device by the end of the semester.

This course is a lot of work in the first and last month and a half. You may find for a week or two in the middle of the semester, you feel like there isnt much to be done. Make sure you spend that time catching up or working ahead in classes as the end of the semester can be just as busy as the first month and a half was.",medium,25
CS 445,"I took this course along with one other in my first semester of the program. I found the class to be enjoyable as the lectures talked about many different topics and actually discussed them for a bit rather than glancing over them. As much as I liked the lectures, sometimes they were dry and long to the point they were hard to listen to if I didn't take a short break.

There are ""practice quizzes"" at the end of most lectures which are supposed to help with the exams but I found that to only be applicable for the final and not the midterm. I found both exams to be difficult but still fair material-wise. The final is cumulative so there's a lot more to remember for it but I thought it was much easier than the midterm. That said I still did well on both exams. They are not on ProctorU so big big win for the class.

The MP's were the most rewarding part of the class and the main reason why I found this class hard. They cover very interesting topics and really get you working on the math but the end result is super cool. You'll need to earn 500 points across 5 MP's but there's so much extra credit under the ""bells and whistles"" that I was able to get 500 points from doing the first 3.5 MP's fully (including all the extra credit). You also get a total number of ""late days"" across the semester that you can use on any project which was very helpful as my schedule got really busy at one point.

There was also a final project. Just need to have a good group for it since it is a big one. The more points from the MP's you have before the final project the better because the last MP and the final project overlap a lot in scheduling and it's hard to balance them.

Overall a great class, ended with an A-.",hard,12
CS 445,"I'm working full-time and took DL4H as well, got A in both.

The exams were pretty tough and are done without proctoring which is a big plus for this course. The questions are complex and specific, they did a good job building an exam that really tests your knowledge without having someone watching you scratch your head.

The lectures cover too much content maybe, the world of Computational Photography is wide and the amount of techniques and methods we learned was a bit overwhelming. It will probably need some refreshing now that this field is rapidly changing.

The assignments were the fun part, they guide you very well and let you use external methods. You use your own photos which is fun and gives something to show.

The final project is the coolest I had in the degree. You can choose whtever topic you want and the results are judged based on the difficulty of the idea, so a perfect result is not necessarily expected.",hard,12

CS 447,"Great class overall! Goes into depth on the fundamentals of NLP. While I think it's important to understand the fundamentals, I do wish the class covered more recent NLP advancements. With rise of LLMs, a lot of what is covered in this class is obsolete.

The lectures were just okay. They focused too much on linguistics and not enough on the ML side of things for my preferences. I'm not very interested in that side of things, so I found them difficult to get through at times.

The MPs were great - I loved the practical application of these. They are auto-graded, and you can submit multiple times to get the grade you want. That being said, MP 3 took a few years off my life, and after 20+ hours working on it, I gave up when I got the auto-grader to 94%. Hopefully they make some changes before the next semester, but be warned!

The quizzes were fair, but as others stated, it takes a long time to get your grades back for these. I wish it was a bit quicker since they are multiple choice.

I enjoyed the literature review and liked that we had to read research papers for it. You essentially have to pick an NLP topic and summarize + analyze 4-5 research papers on this topic. This is definitely a useful skill to have in industry! I was nervous about grading, but it was peer graded and very lenient. Put in a decent effort on this, and you will likely be rewarded with a good grade.

Overall, a great class, and I would recommend it to anyone in the program!",medium,15
CS 447,"This is a pretty high quality course with a good professor, a well designed syllabus, and an excellent mix of assignments to complement the lectures. Having no exams is a huge bonus and stress reliever as well. Lectures are very dense and understanding them is crucial for good performance in the class overall. This, in addition to the very open ended and substantial literature review, is why I would only recommend this class if you are genuinely interested in NLP. If you aren't, then you are not going to enjoy the lectures, you're going to hate the assignments, and the literature review will be a nightmare.",hard,15
CS 447,"This course mixes classical NLP with deep learning approaches. It consists of 4 parts, which are tought simultaneously: Lecture with graded quizzes (12), peer-reviewed excercises for each week (12), home work assignments (4) and literature review (1, peer-reviewed).

And I hope the online MCS program will offer more advanced courses, such as numerical computation of partial differential equations and HPC that takes computer architecture into account.",medium,10
CS 450,"This is a remarkably useful course with a lot of relevant information. The workload is high, but Prof Kloeckner regularly collects and is receptive to feedback.",hard,15
CS 450,"This is the last course before I graduate and also the hardest one. It's delivered together with onsite students so the standard and workload is way higher. I've some knowledge of programming and statistics but not too deep in linear algebra and matrix calculus. This course enhanced my background in those parts, by topics of linear system, OLS, optimization, interpolation, ODE, etc. Weekly homework plus 3 midterm and one final aren’t fun, not to say the 4-credit graduate student need to take 2 extra assignments, each is equivalent of 2.5 regular homework. Can easily spend 20hrs+ each week on the 2.5 hr long lecture video, homework, preparing exams. However, I still think this is one of the most useful courses on the theory side.",very hard,25
CS 463,"This class was interesting and overall I'd recommend it, particularly if you have an interest in the field of security. There were 5 MPs that if I'm remembering correctly, were all auto-graded. Nothing too difficult or surprising there, some good exercises that demonstrate various security related items. (The password guessing one was particularly enjoyable.) They are a bit challenging at times though, but not too bad. The videos are pretty good, sometimes a little hard to follow and theorem-heavy, but overall pretty good.

The interesting/tricky part of the course, I thought, were the exams. The midterm was completely open-book, but there was material on there that hadn't been covered whatsoever in class, to some students chagrin, it seemed. However, I think he gave something like 3 free points (where you could miss a total of 3 questions before your grade started going down). There was a time limit if I remember correctly, but it wasn't too bad on that one. These were all multiple choice, and though it was hard, it wasn't too difficult to get a decent grade given it was open book and the grace points, plus I think it may have ended up getting curved as well.

The hardest and most stressful part for me was the final. Unlike any other course I've taken in the program that has had exams (Cloud Computing Applications, Database Systems, Cloud Networking), the questions were at least in part open-ended. (Yikes!) I studied fairly extensively, and you are given the option to use a one page front/back handwritten note sheet, if I am remembering correctly. Still though, it was tough, and time was tight (for me at least). Fortunately, the grading was pretty lenient I think (he even came out and said so), and also there may have been a curve. Coming out of the test I thought there might actually be a small chance I wasn't going to pass the course, but I ended up getting I think a B on it and finished with an A-. (I had also done subpar on the midterm, but that wasn't weighted too heavily I don't think.)

Anyway, it was a good course and hard at times but not overly difficult. Very interesting theoretical foundation for computer security.",hard,12
CS 463,"I found the lectures in this class to be really, really interesting. You cover a lot of topics that apply to the real world. The delivery of the lectures is also good as well and the professor covers them concisely and engagingly.

The MPs were not too easy and not too hard. They actually relate to content learned in the class and again covered concepts that were cool and made you genuinely excited to do the MP. They are structured in a way that splits it up into different parts which progressively get harder. This helps because you don't feel discouraged at the size of the MP and rather can attack it in smaller chunks. There was an autograder which you can run as many times as you want before the submission deadline so you pretty much know your grade before turning it in (a small chunk is manually graded as well). The assignments were primarily in python and java.

The TAs and students were always active on Campuswire so anytime someone had a question it was quickly answered with a short response time. There are two exams - the midterm and the final. Both are open-note and MC. Not exactly a walk in the park but if you have been following lectures it shouldn't be too hard, especially considering the fact you can use outside resources.

I am walking away having learned a lot of information from this class, refined coding and debugging skills, and a plethora of knowledge on computer security. Highly recommend all students to take this class.",medium,10
CS 463,"This is a course unlike any security course outside, it focus on teaching you the mindset of researchers, to approach to a security problem systematically. A wide variety of modern security topics are discussed, including Bitcoin, Autonomous vehicle, Privacy, Inference, Machine Learning, Cyber Warfare etc. The format of lecture does not follow any books but Professor would discuss about a representative paper that he chose that is related to modern security topics. The course videos are new as it’s taken last year and still up to date. I personally found this kind of lecture really amazing because it’s not something that you could read from textbook but rather what professor thinks it’s important. Gang has an ability to explain abstract concept in a very simple way that you would easily understand. The chosen topics are also closely related to our daily life and you will find it quite practical and interesting. At least I feel amazed when I learn about Private set Intersection and really implemented it in the MP.

Speaking of MP, it is mainly related to the lectures, you would need a good understanding of the concepts behind. Since it is a data focused security course, it also assumed that you have some background in data science, at least know something about classifiers and clustering algorithm. As I did not have any data science background, I had a hard time during MP1 since it requires you to implement a clustering algorithm from scratch using only numpy. But I also learned a lot from it and the MPs forced me to bite the bullet and learn those data science concepts. (P.S. helper functions are definitely allowed in the MPs.) TAs are also responsive and helpful to guide you through the MPs, given that you start early and asks good questions. My favourite MP was one that using the power of inferencing to find out the bitcoin address of Silk Road from real bitcoin transaction data. Exams are all MC this year and unfortunately they do not have essay nor extra credits. My final grade is A+.

Overall it is a great course, don’t miss it out because of the bad reviews, strongly recommend anyone that has interest in computer security to take this course.",medium,12
CS 463,"I am a little biased as I am interested in Computer Security, but I thought this was an awesome class. Professor Wang is very passionate about the subject, and bases his lectures around academic papers. He goes into the weeds for the mathematical models of the concepts, but the weekly quizzes seem fair on their level of detail.

The course has 5 MPs, that do test more on the understanding of the concepts instead of coding skills. The actual code isn't hundreds of lines, but each homework assignment took me the full 3 weeks to understand and implement. MP4 was a bit of a mess as it was a new assignment, and had to be done in an EC2 instance (no instructions on how to set this up were given, but if you have been through CCA it will be intuitive, if not, there are a ton of resources out there). You will have to do research on each MP, and the grading on the MP questions are specific and test knowledge of the concepts (a few are a little tricky). The MP set ups might take a bit if you aren't as familiar with command line executions (same as CCA).

There is a midterm and a final, both are open note, and the final has 75% of the questions on the material in the second half and 25% on the first half of the class. There were two sections for the midterm, multiple choice and a short answer. Questions were detailed, but fair.

Our TA Limin has been very patient, and is very knowledgeable. He has been understanding and helpful when we have run into issues with MPs.

",hard,10
CS 475,"Interesting class. Deeper dive into the differences between complexity classes. A lot more context into Big O notation, P vs NP, and philosophically why things are uncomputable. I had no idea there was this much to it, but I feel more confident calling myself a computer scientist / mathematician now.

The class itself is all math. There are no coding projects. Exams are proctored. Weekly graded warmups, and tri-weekly homework. It's like Discrete Math on steroids. Lots of proofs. Pure theory.

The class itself is not that much work, it's just really hard. I majored in pure mathematics and have a background in algorithms, which helped me to learn a lot of the material quickly. If you don't have that, expect to study at least 15 hours a week.

TA's are great. Responsive and give HW feedback if you ask. The professor is kinda absent. He doesn't provide answer sheets, or lecture slides. He's not that nice tbh but he doesn't get in your way either so its fine.",very hard,10
CS 484,"I should have heeded the past reviews of this course but I let my interest in the topic and optimism that course staff might be responsive to feedback get the better of me. That was a mistake.

As others have noted, the instructor is checked out, but the same is largely true of the TA.

That actually wouldn't be an issue for me if the course were set up competently such that it could run itself — that is, if the materials were bug-free. No such luck.

The midterm was misgraded, some of the machine problems and quizzes had bugs in their autograding scripts that required tedious back-and-forth with TAs to fix, and in general there has been a consistent lack of responsiveness from course staff. One assignment's non-functional autograder wasn't fixed until more than two months after staff were notified it was broken via Piazza.

By the time we had completed Week 10, assignments from Weeks 3, 4, and 6 remained ungraded. Student inquiries regarding these delays on Piazza went completely unacknowledged.

Re. the midterm: Since it was mis-graded, the feedback provided via Coursera was erroneous -- this has not been fixed. The TA promised a solution guide and gave an ETA for it...then quietly ignored it. When reminded and asked for an updated ETA, she offered one... then again quietly ignored her estimated delivery date. This is just a lack of basic professionalism — don't make promises you don't intend to keep. (On that note: Office Hours have been repeatedly canceled at the last minute.)

I deeply regret spending $3k+ on this course.",medium,15
CS 484,"So first of all, the reviews below are spot on. The professor doesn't do anything in the class. The lectures are from a professor that quit teaching the class years ago. I saw like 2 or 3 comments in Piazza on some questions students had. The answers looked like text responses from a child in grade school and offered zero help to the student. The TAs on the other hand were extremely helpful. They did sort of vanish around finals week as I am assuming they too had finals, but it was unfortunate as I saw a lot of students questions around the last two assignments go unanswered.

So let's talk now about the assignments. They are all C++ where you usually just need to implement a few stub functions. You won't be using C++ constructs like classes, so if you have C experience that will be good. If you have neither, I would brush up before starting this class. I can imagine if you don't it can be a struggle to learn it on the fly.

Altogether were I think 4 written homeworks where you had to answer some questions (last one required some coding), 3 MPs and a final project that was really just an expanded MP. The grading on the MPs seemed to be very lenient. The midterm was not too difficult. The final had a multiple choice and a written component. The written component seemed to be graded pretty tough, and from that I bombed the final. All that being said, still had a comfortable A regardless if they had curved the grades or not (which I am not sure if they did or not).

Even though the lectures are a little older, the concepts are still relevant. I really liked the class as I am more focused on pure CS type courses as opposed to the plethora of data science classes that are offered. All in all, it seems like this class produced different experiences for different students. In the end, I really enjoyed the class. It could be because I enjoy the subject, and as such I do not look to discredit other reviews as it seems quite a few other students, especially in the Spring 2022 semester had a terrible experience. For me however, I definitely feel I got something out of the class and enjoyed taking it.",medium,10
CS 484,"Instructor (Lawrence Rauchwerger) is virtually absent from class, lecture vids are from a different prof who used to teach it (Laxmikant V Kale).

Shoutout to TAs, who CARRIED the course with their responsiveness and helpfulness on Piazza and OH. Older reviews for this course, especially Spring 2022 semester, seemed to have a rough experience & I'm guessing it's related to how helpful/invested the TAs are, so YMMV.

Interesting & challenging projects using MPI & OpenMP, they were also super generous with extensions for projects. Off the bat, projects were still pretty unorganized as mentioned from past reviews, like there were edits needed to be made in the batch scripts, etc. to get it running. Luckily TAs were helpful in addressing these issues quickly through posts & announcements on Piazza",medium,20
CS 598 PSL,"This class has a lot of hands on projects, which I really enjoyed. I highly recommend forming a solid group - this will make your time in the class much easier! The TAs and professor were very responsive and helpful, and the class was graded very fairly. It is 40% for quizzes (can submit as many times as you want), 6% for each coding assignment (5 total), and 7.5% for each project (4 total).

Overall, this was one of my favorite classes I've taken in this course. I would highly recommend taking this instead of AML as it covers similar concepts, but is much more effective.",medium,15
CS 598 PSL,"Feng Liang was the instructor for Fall 2024 and made the course a positive experience. She was extremely responsive on CampusWire and provided helpful hints for assignments and projects. The material is somewhat math-heavy and provides a nice overview of common ML methods. The textbook written by the professor is very clear and I preferred reading it over watching the lectures, but the content is the same. Some projects are inspired by Kaggle projects so it's easy to link what is being taught to ""real-world"" applications. The workload is busy every week, but still manageable especially with a solid group for assignments and projects. The late submission policy is also generous, with a cumulative 7 days that can be spread out among all assignments and projects.",medium,12
CS 598 PSL,"This course will make you work non-stop with not much breaks. With 4 challenging coding assignments and 4 projects, I always felt like I had something due next week. But the work was worth it. To sum up how you learn, the lectures and books take you through the algorithim that you are trying to solve, like classification and then it walks you through how different machine learning algorithms are derived from that problem. This gives you a tense mathematical understanding of each of the core basic algorithms out there. The homework then makes you apply one of these algorithms by writing the code for it. The projects are recycled kaggle competitions that allow you to apply these methods and figure out different ways to maximize these algorithms and meet a threshold needed to achieve full points. These thresholds are normally very high and hard to achieve and have a very specific way needed to achieve it. This what was frustrating about this class. A very high bar was always set which was difficult to achieve but then the answers were given out either directly on campuswire or through office hours. Not being able to achieve the needed scores or figure out the homeworks on your own were deflating. I think the professor could have done a slightly better job at teaching us to get us to that point or making the thresholds and assignments just a tad easier. But what doesn't kill you, makes you stronger and this class definitely did that. If you are in this program for data science then this is a must take.

CS 598 DLH,"Great course! However, this semester, a Midterm was added. Based on previous reviews, this was never the case. The Midterm was proctored and closed book.

I would say as a full-time working professional, I spent about 20 - 30 hours a week on this course. The Professor and the TAs are/were working on a brand new book and thus weekly reflections were missed some weeks.",hard,25
CS 598 DLH,"I'm working full-time and took CS 445 as well, got A in both.

The content of the course is great although it might spread too much over a lot of deep learning techniques. This is why the lecture videos are a bit difficult to put your head around.

The assignments however are prefectly structured and very fairly graded. They introduce you to the healthcare data but sometimes you can solve them without understanding what each deep learning technique does to the fullest.

The final project is interesting but make sure you pick an interesting paper with available code, otherwise you're going to spend weeks on it.",medum,8
CS 598 DLH,"The class touches almost all the major topics of deep learning, and homework assignments actually make you use them.

A lot of people mentioned that it only takes 10 hours per week and they disliked the course, thats because they did not do the quizzes and the labs (which are optional). If you do all of them, it's actually closer to 20 hours rather than 10! The quizzes and labs actually strengthen your understanding in deep learning and are very practical! Do the optional assignments if you wish to learn!


For the weekly reflection you do see some lazy students who write very little, but you will also be surprised to read some awesome answers from smart and hard working students!

The textbook is borderline useless in explaining concepts. It doesn't explain anything well, but if you take time and search it up online or use chatgpt (a bonus available now!) you can get some understanding of the topics it presented. The video makes you sleepy so I don't even bother watching them after third week.


Final projects is either a hit or miss. I chose a 2018 paper but it ended up to be a disaster due to compatibility issues, and didn't learn a whole lot on it. I would suggest picking something more recent and that's reproducible in authors code, so you don't have headaches dealing with old software and libraries that the authors use.",hard,15
CS 598 FDC,"This course was in transition between 2 professors, and it showed. The lectures were decent quality as were the readings and the professors were clearly very knowledgeable, but it felt like this class was struggling with direction and making the content actionable for students in graduate setting.

The quizzes are easy. There's an open book final which is just as easy.

I put almost no effort into this class and got an A. Would not recommend unless you want an easy A paired with a tougher class, or you're super passionate about the topic.",very easy,1
CS 598 FDC,"The course was pretty easy, the assignments were new this semester and generally well run (assignment 1 had some faulty autograder issues, but the professor fixed it and gave students ample time. Assignments 2-4 were smoother). The quizzes were easy and 3 attempts were generous. Good opportunities for extra credit via a course survey + forum participation on campuswire. The course forums were active and useful as a result. I haven't taken the final yet so can't concretely say anything there, but I'm not worried. Even with a 0 on it I could get a B-. Syllabus can be found https://cirss.github.io/cs598-data-curation/about.html.

CS 598 FDC,"Foundations of Data Curation is an in-depth and highly valuable course for anyone interested in the growing field of data curation. It effectively combines theory (sometimes philosophical) with hands-on practice, to manage data lifecycles in research, industry, or archival settings.

The course lectures are just the best! The professor sometimes goes deep in explaining concepts of abstraction and indirections - which I really enjoyed. The course requires engagement with both conceptual and practical content, which may be difficult for students less comfortable with abstract thinking or theory.

The course assignments are not difficult, but need time and diligence to write up. Students who are organized and proactive with the assignments will find the workload manageable, while those who struggle with technical tools may need to spend extra time familiarizing themselves with the software and standards used in data curation. There are also several research papers to read - make sure to allocate time every week to read them.

There are several opportunities for extra credit - which can help you make up for points lost in assignments.

Campuswire questions always left unanswered and TA office hours are non-existent.
